     > In this problem, I got TLE and Runtime error many times. First I got runtime error since I declared size of array less than required. I declared it 10^5+5 but required was 2*(10^5). I thought problem was with initialization of array and I initialised array till 10^5 for each test case. Got TLE . Finally realised correct size and initialised according to problem. Got TLE. Didn't initialised. Got TLE. Then to find value of key in map, earlier I was using for loop, changed it to map.find() and solution was accepted. GOOD QUESTION.
